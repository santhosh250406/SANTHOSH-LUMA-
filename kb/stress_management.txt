Stress is the body’s reaction to any challenge or demand. It can be positive in small doses, but chronic stress can harm your health. 

Common causes of stress include work pressure, academic challenges, financial issues, and personal relationships.

Effective stress management techniques:
1. **Deep Breathing** – Practice slow, mindful breathing to calm your body.
2. **Physical Activity** – Exercise releases endorphins, which naturally reduce stress.
3. **Time Management** – Prioritize tasks and break big goals into smaller steps.
4. **Relaxation Practices** – Meditation, yoga, or listening to calming music can help.
5. **Healthy Lifestyle** – Maintain a balanced diet and regular sleep schedule.
6. **Social Connection** – Talking with friends or loved ones helps relieve stress.

Remember: you can’t always control your stressors, but you can control your reaction to them.
