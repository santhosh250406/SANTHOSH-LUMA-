Mental health refers to a person’s emotional, psychological, and social well-being. 
It affects how we think, feel, and act, and also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. 

Good mental health is not just the absence of mental disorders—it involves maintaining a balance in various aspects of life. 
Common signs of mental wellness include:
- Feeling confident in yourself
- Being able to manage stress effectively
- Maintaining healthy relationships
- Having a sense of purpose or direction

Factors that affect mental health:
- Biological factors (genes, brain chemistry)
- Life experiences (trauma, abuse)
- Family history of mental health problems
- Lifestyle habits (sleep, nutrition, exercise)

If you experience ongoing sadness, loss of interest, or difficulty functioning, it’s important to seek help from a counselor or mental health professional.
