Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress, but excessive or persistent anxiety can interfere with daily life. 
Symptoms may include restlessness, rapid heartbeat, difficulty concentrating, and sleep problems.

Coping strategies for anxiety:
- **Grounding Techniques**: Focus on your senses (what you can see, hear, feel) to stay in the present moment.
- **Cognitive Restructuring**: Challenge irrational or negative thoughts and replace them with balanced ones.
- **Physical Exercise**: Regular movement helps reduce tension and improve mood.
- **Breathing Exercises**: Inhale slowly through your nose, exhale through your mouth to calm the nervous system.
- **Mindfulness Meditation**: Observe thoughts without judgment to reduce overthinking.
- **Professional Support**: Therapy or counseling can provide long-term coping tools.

If anxiety interferes with daily functioning, professional guidance is highly recommended.
